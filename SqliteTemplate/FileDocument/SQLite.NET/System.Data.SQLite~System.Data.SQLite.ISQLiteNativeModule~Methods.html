The xBestIndex method has a prototype like this: <pre class="code">int (*xBestIndex)(sqlite3_vtab *pVTab, sqlite3_index_info*);
</pre> The SQLite core communicates with the xBestIndex method by filling in certain fields of the sqlite3_index_info structure and passing a pointer to that structure into xBestIndex as the second parameter. The xBestIndex method fills out other fields of this structure which forms the reply. The sqlite3_index_info structure looks like this: <pre class="code">struct sqlite3_index_info {
  /* Inputs */
  const int nConstraint;     /* Number of entries in aConstraint */
  const struct sqlite3_index_constraint {

  const int nOrderBy;        /* Number of terms in the ORDER BY clause */
  const struct sqlite3_index_orderby {

</pre> Note the warnings on the "estimatedRows", "idxFlags", and colUsed fields. These fields were added with SQLite versions 3.8.2, 3.9.0, and 3.10.0, respectively. Any extension that reads or writes these fields must first check that the version of the SQLite library in use is greater than or equal to appropriate version - perhaps comparing the value returned from sqlite3_libversion_number() against constants 3008002, 3009000, and/or 3010000. The result of attempting to access these fields in an sqlite3_index_info structure created by an older version of SQLite are undefined.

</pre> Use the sqlite3_vtab_collation() interface to find the name of the collating sequence that should be used when evaluating the i-th constraint: <pre class="code">const char *sqlite3_vtab_collation(sqlite3_index_info*, int i);
</pre> The SQLite core calls the xBestIndex method when it is compiling a query that involves a virtual table. In other words, SQLite calls this method when it is running sqlite3_prepare() or the equivalent. By calling this method, the SQLite core is saying to the virtual table that it needs to access some subset of the rows in the virtual table and it wants to know the most efficient way to do that access. The xBestIndex method replies with information that the SQLite core can then use to conduct an efficient search of the virtual table.  While compiling a single SQL query, the SQLite core might call xBestIndex multiple times with different settings in sqlite3_index_info. The SQLite core will then select the combination that appears to give the best performance.  Before calling this method, the SQLite core initializes an instance of the sqlite3_index_info structure with information about the query that it is currently trying to process. This information derives mainly from the WHERE clause and ORDER BY or GROUP BY clauses of the query, but also from any ON or USING clauses if the query is a join. The information that the SQLite core provides to the xBestIndex method is held in the part of the structure that is marked as "Inputs". The "Outputs" section is initialized to zero.  The information in the sqlite3_index_info structure is ephemeral and may be overwritten or deallocated as soon as the xBestIndex method returns. If the xBestIndex method needs to remember any part of the sqlite3_index_info structure, it should make a copy. Care must be take to store the copy in a place where it will be deallocated, such as in the idxStr field with needToFreeIdxStr set to 1.  Note that xBestIndex will always be called before xFilter, since the idxNum and idxStr outputs from xBestIndex are required inputs to xFilter. However, there is no guarantee that xFilter will be called following a successful xBestIndex.  The xBestIndex method is required for every virtual table implementation.  The main thing that the SQLite core is trying to communicate to the virtual table is the constraints that are available to limit the number of rows that need to be searched. The aConstraint[] array contains one entry for each constraint. There will be exactly nConstraint entries in that array.  Each constraint will usually correspond to a term in the WHERE clause or in a USING or ON clause that is of the form <pre class="code">     column  OP  EXPR
</pre> Where "column" is a column in the virtual table, OP is an operator like "=" or "&lt;", and EXPR is an arbitrary expression. So, for example, if the WHERE clause contained a term like this: <pre class="code">a = 5
</pre> Then one of the constraints would be on the "a" column with operator "=" and an expression of "5". Constraints need not have a literal representation of the WHERE clause. The query optimizer might make transformations to the WHERE clause in order to extract as many constraints as it can. So, for example, if the WHERE clause contained something like this: <pre class="code">x BETWEEN 10 AND 100 AND 999&gt;y
</pre> The query optimizer might translate this into three separate constraints: <pre class="code">x &gt;= 10
x &lt;= 100
y &lt; 999
</pre> For each such constraint, the aConstraint[].iColumn field indicates which column appears on the left-hand side of the constraint. The first column of the virtual table is column 0. The rowid of the virtual table is column -1. The aConstraint[].op field indicates which operator is used. The SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_* constants map integer constants into operator values. Columns occur in the order they were defined by the call to sqlite3_declare_vtab() in the xCreate or xConnect method. Hidden columns are counted when determining the column index.  If the xFindFunction() method for the virtual table is defined, and if xFindFunction() sometimes returns SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_FUNCTION or larger, then the constraints might also be of the form: <pre class="code">     FUNCTION( column, EXPR)
</pre> In this case the aConstraint[].op value is the same as the value returned by xFindFunction() for FUNCTION.  The aConstraint[] array contains information about all constraints that apply to the virtual table. But some of the constraints might not be usable because of the way tables are ordered in a join. The xBestIndex method must therefore only consider constraints that have an aConstraint[].usable flag which is true.  In addition to WHERE clause constraints, the SQLite core also tells the xBestIndex method about the ORDER BY clause. (In an aggregate query, the SQLite core might put in GROUP BY clause information in place of the ORDER BY clause information, but this fact should not make any difference to the xBestIndex method.) If all terms of the ORDER BY clause are columns in the virtual table, then nOrderBy will be the number of terms in the ORDER BY clause and the aOrderBy[] array will identify the column for each term in the order by clause and whether or not that column is ASC or DESC.  In SQLite version 3.10.0 (2016-01-06) and later, the colUsed field is available to indicate which fields of the virtual table are actually used by the statement being prepared. If the lowest bit of colUsed is set, that means that the first column is used. The second lowest bit corresponds to the second column. And so forth. If the most significant bit of colUsed is set, that means that one or more columns other than the first 63 columns are used. If column usage information is needed by the xFilter method, then the required bits must be encoded into either the output idxNum field or idxStr content.  For the LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, and MATCH operators, the aConstraint[].iColumn value is the virtual table column that is the left operand of the operator. However, if these operators are expressed as function calls instead of operators, then the aConstraint[].iColumn value references the virtual table column that is the second argument to that function: <pre class="code">LIKE(<i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">EXPR</i>, <i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">column</i>)<br>
GLOB(<i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">EXPR</i>, <i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">column</i>)<br>
REGEXP(<i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">EXPR</i>, <i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">column</i>)<br>
MATCH(<i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">EXPR</i>, <i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">column</i>)<br></pre> Hence, as far as the xBestIndex() method is concerned, the following two forms are equivalent: <pre class="code"><i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">column</i> LIKE <i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">EXPR</i><br>
      LIKE(<i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">EXPR</i>,<i xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">column</i>)
      </pre> This special behavior of looking at the second argument of a function only occurs for the LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, and MATCH functions. For all other functions, the aConstraint[].iColumn value references the first argument of the function.  This special feature of LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, and MATCH does not apply to the xFindFunction() method, however. The xFindFunction() method always keys off of the left operand of an LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, or MATCH operator but off of the first argument to function-call equivalents of those operators.  When aConstraint[].op is one of SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_LIMIT or SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_OFFSET, that indicates that there is a LIMIT or OFFSET clause on the SQL query statement that is using the virtual table. The LIMIT and OFFSET operators have no left operand, and so when aConstraint[].op is one of SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_LIMIT or SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_OFFSET then the aConstraint[].iColumn value is meaningless and should not be used.  The sqlite3_vtab_rhs_value() interface can be used to try to access the right-hand operand of a constraint. However, the value of a right-hand operator might not be known at the time that the xBestIndex method is run, so the sqlite3_vtab_rhs_value() call might not be successful. Usually the right operand of a constraint is only available to xBestIndex if it is coded as a literal value in the input SQL. If the right operand is coded as an expression or a host parameter, it probably will not be accessible to xBestIndex. Some operators, such as SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_ISNULL and SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_ISNOTNULL have no right-hand operand. The sqlite3_vtab_rhs_value() interface always returns SQLITE_NOTFOUND for such operators.  Given all of the information above, the job of the xBestIndex method it to figure out the best way to search the virtual table.  The xBestIndex method conveys an indexing strategy to the xFilter method through the idxNum and idxStr fields. The idxNum value and idxStr string content are arbitrary as far as the SQLite core is concerned and can have any meaning as long as xBestIndex and xFilter agree on what that meaning is. The SQLite core just copies the information from xBestIndex through to the xFilter method, assuming only that the char sequence referenced via idxStr is NUL terminated.  The idxStr value may be a string obtained from an SQLite memory allocation function such as sqlite3_mprintf(). If this is the case, then the needToFreeIdxStr flag must be set to true so that the SQLite core will know to call sqlite3_free() on that string when it has finished with it, and thus avoid a memory leak. The idxStr value may also be a static constant string, in which case the needToFreeIdxStr boolean should remain false.  The estimatedCost field should be set to the estimated number of disk access operations required to execute this query against the virtual table. The SQLite core will often call xBestIndex multiple times with different constraints, obtain multiple cost estimates, then choose the query plan that gives the lowest estimate. The SQLite core initializes estimatedCost to a very large value prior to invoking xBestIndex, so if xBestIndex determines that the current combination of parameters is undesirable, it can leave the estimatedCost field unchanged to discourage its use.  If the current version of SQLite is 3.8.2 or greater, the estimatedRows field may be set to an estimate of the number of rows returned by the proposed query plan. If this value is not explicitly set, the default estimate of 25 rows is used.  If the current version of SQLite is 3.9.0 or greater, the idxFlags field may be set to SQLITE_INDEX_SCAN_UNIQUE to indicate that the virtual table will return only zero or one rows given the input constraints. Additional bits of the idxFlags field might be understood in later versions of SQLite.  The aConstraintUsage[] array contains one element for each of the nConstraint constraints in the inputs section of the sqlite3_index_info structure. The aConstraintUsage[] array is used by xBestIndex to tell the core how it is using the constraints.  The xBestIndex method may set aConstraintUsage[].argvIndex entries to values greater than zero. Exactly one entry should be set to 1, another to 2, another to 3, and so forth up to as many or as few as the xBestIndex method wants. The EXPR of the corresponding constraints will then be passed in as the argv[] parameters to xFilter.  For example, if the aConstraint[3].argvIndex is set to 1, then when xFilter is called, the argv[0] passed to xFilter will have the EXPR value of the aConstraint[3] constraint.  By default, the SQLite generates bytecode that will double checks all constraints on each row of the virtual table to verify that they are satisfied. If the virtual table can guarantee that a constraint will always be satisfied, it can try to suppress that double-check by setting aConstraintUsage[].omit. However, with some exceptions, this is only a hint and there is no guarantee that the redundant check of the constraint will be suppressed. Key points: <ul><li> The omit flag is only honored if the argvIndex value for the constraint is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 16. Constraint checking is never suppressed for constraints that do not pass their right operand into the xFilter method. The current implementation is only able to suppress redundant constraint checking for the first 16 values passed to xFilter, though that limitation might be increased in future releases. </li><li> The omit flag is always honored for SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_OFFSET constraints as long as argvIndex is greater than 0. Setting the omit flag on an SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_OFFSET constraint indicates to SQLite that the virtual table will itself suppress the first N rows of output, where N is the right operand of the OFFSET operator. If the virtual table implementation sets omit on an SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_OFFSET constraint but then fails to suppress the first N rows of output, an incorrect answer will result from the overall query. </li></ul> If the virtual table will output rows in the order specified by the ORDER BY clause, then the orderByConsumed flag may be set to true. If the output is not automatically in the correct order then orderByConsumed must be left in its default false setting. This will indicate to the SQLite core that it will need to do a separate sorting pass over the data after it comes out of the virtual table. Setting orderByConsumed is an optimization. A query will always get the correct answer if orderByConsumed is left at its default value (0). Unnecessary sort operations might be avoided resulting in a faster query if orderByConsumed is set, but setting orderByConsumed incorrectly can result in an incorrect answer. It is suggested that new virtual table implementations leave the orderByConsumed value unset initially, and then after everything else is known to be working correctly, go back and attempt to optimize by setting orderByConsumed where appropriate.  Sometimes the orderByConsumed flag can be safely set even if the outputs from the virtual table are not strictly in the order specified by nOrderBy and aOrderBy. If the sqlite3_vtab_distinct() interface returns 1 or 2, that indicates that the ordering can be relaxed. See the documentation on sqlite3_vtab_distinct() for further information.  The xBestIndex method should return SQLITE_OK on success. If any kind of fatal error occurs, an appropriate error code (ex: SQLITE_NOMEM) should be returned instead.  If xBestIndex returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, that does not indicate an error. Rather, SQLITE_CONSTRAINT indicates that the particular combination of input parameters specified is insufficient for the virtual table to do its job. This is logically the same as setting the estimatedCost to infinity. If every call to xBestIndex for a particular query plan returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, that means there is no way for the virtual table to be safely used, and the sqlite3_prepare() call will fail with a "no query solution" error.  The SQLITE_CONSTRAINT return from xBestIndex is useful for table-valued functions that have required parameters. If the aConstraint[].usable field is false for one of the required parameter, then the xBestIndex method should return SQLITE_CONSTRAINT. If a required field does not appear in the aConstraint[] array at all, that means that the corresponding parameter is omitted from the input SQL. In that case, xBestIndex should set an error message in pVTab-&gt;zErrMsg and return SQLITE_ERROR. To summarize: <ol><li> The aConstraint[].usable value for a required parameter is false <big xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">→</big> return SQLITE_CONSTRAINT. </li><li> A required parameter does not appears anywhere in the aConstraint[] array <big xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">→</big> Set an error message in pVTab-&gt;zErrMsg and return SQLITE_ERROR </li></ol> The following example will better illustrate the use of SQLITE_CONSTRAINT as a return value from xBestIndex: <pre class="code">SELECT * FROM realtab, tablevaluedfunc(realtab.x);
</pre> Assuming that the first hidden column of "tablevaluedfunc" is "param1", the query above is semantically equivalent to this: <pre class="code">SELECT * FROM realtab, tablevaluedfunc
 WHERE tablevaluedfunc.param1 = realtab.x;
</pre> The query planner must decide between many possible implementations of this query, but two plans in particular are of note: <ol><li>Scan all rows of realtab and for each row, find rows in tablevaluedfunc where param1 is equal to realtab.x </li><li>Scan all rows of tablevalued func and for each row find rows in realtab where x is equal to tablevaluedfunc.param1. </li></ol> The xBestIndex method will be invoked once for each of the potential plans above. For plan 1, the aConstraint[].usable flag for the SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_EQ constraint on the param1 column will be true because the right-hand side value for the "param1 = ?" constraint will be known, since it is determined by the outer realtab loop. But for plan 2, the aConstraint[].usable flag for "param1 = ?" will be false because the right-hand side value is determined by an inner loop and is thus an unknown quantity. Because param1 is a required input to the table-valued functions, the xBestIndex method should return SQLITE_CONSTRAINT when presented with plan 2, indicating that a required input is missing. This forces the query planner to select plan 1. </td></tr>

This method must release all resources allocated by the corresponding xOpen call. The routine will not be called again even if it returns an error.

</pre> The SQLite core invokes this method in order to find the value for the N-th column of the current row. N is zero-based so the first column is numbered 0. The xColumn method may return its result back to SQLite using one of the following interface: <ul><li> sqlite3_result_blob() </li><li> sqlite3_result_double() </li><li> sqlite3_result_int() </li><li> sqlite3_result_int64() </li><li> sqlite3_result_null() </li><li> sqlite3_result_text() </li><li> sqlite3_result_text16() </li><li> sqlite3_result_text16le() </li><li> sqlite3_result_text16be() </li><li> sqlite3_result_zeroblob() </li></ul> If the xColumn method implementation calls none of the functions above, then the value of the column defaults to an SQL NULL.  To raise an error, the xColumn method should use one of the result_text() methods to set the error message text, then return an appropriate error code.

<tr VALIGN="top"><td width="50%"><img src="pubmethod.gif"></img><a href="System.Data.SQLite~System.Data.SQLite.ISQLiteNativeModule.xConnect.html">xConnect</a></td><td width="50%"><pre class="code">int (*xConnect)(sqlite3*, void *pAux,
             int argc, char *const*argv,
             sqlite3_vtab **ppVTab,
             char **pzErr);
</pre> The xConnect method is very similar to xCreate. It has the same parameters and constructs a new sqlite3_vtab structure just like xCreate. And it must also call sqlite3_declare_vtab() like xCreate. It should also make all of the same sqlite3_vtab_config() calls as xCreate.  The difference is that xConnect is called to establish a new connection to an existing virtual table whereas xCreate is called to create a new virtual table from scratch.  The xCreate and xConnect methods are only different when the virtual table has some kind of backing store that must be initialized the first time the virtual table is created. The xCreate method creates and initializes the backing store. The xConnect method just connects to an existing backing store. When xCreate and xConnect are the same, the table is an eponymous virtual table.  As an example, consider a virtual table implementation that provides read-only access to existing comma-separated-value (CSV) files on disk. There is no backing store that needs to be created or initialized for such a virtual table (since the CSV files already exist on disk) so the xCreate and xConnect methods will be identical for that module.  Another example is a virtual table that implements a full-text index. The xCreate method must create and initialize data structures to hold the dictionary and posting lists for that index. The xConnect method, on the other hand, only has to locate and use an existing dictionary and posting lists that were created by a prior xCreate call.  The xConnect method must return SQLITE_OK if it is successful in creating the new virtual table, or SQLITE_ERROR if it is not successful. If not successful, the sqlite3_vtab structure must not be allocated. An error message may optionally be returned in *pzErr if unsuccessful. Space to hold the error message string must be allocated using an SQLite memory allocation function like sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_mprintf() as the SQLite core will attempt to free the space using sqlite3_free() after the error has been reported up to the application.  The xConnect method is required for every virtual table implementation, though the xCreate and xConnect pointers of the sqlite3_module object may point to the same function if the virtual table does not need to initialize backing store. </td></tr>

             char **pzErr);
</pre> The xCreate method is called to create a new instance of a virtual table in response to a CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement. If the xCreate method is the same pointer as the xConnect method, then the virtual table is an eponymous virtual table. If the xCreate method is omitted (if it is a NULL pointer) then the virtual table is an eponymous-only virtual table.  The db parameter is a pointer to the SQLite database connection that is executing the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement. The pAux argument is the copy of the client data pointer that was the fourth argument to the sqlite3_create_module() or sqlite3_create_module_v2() call that registered the virtual table module. The argv parameter is an array of argc pointers to null terminated strings. The first string, argv[0], is the name of the module being invoked. The module name is the name provided as the second argument to sqlite3_create_module() and as the argument to the USING clause of the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement that is running. The second, argv[1], is the name of the database in which the new virtual table is being created. The database name is "main" for the primary database, or "temp" for TEMP database, or the name given at the end of the ATTACH statement for attached databases. The third element of the array, argv[2], is the name of the new virtual table, as specified following the TABLE keyword in the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement. If present, the fourth and subsequent strings in the argv[] array report the arguments to the module name in the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement.  The job of this method is to construct the new virtual table object (an sqlite3_vtab object) and return a pointer to it in *ppVTab.  As part of the task of creating a new sqlite3_vtab structure, this method <u xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">must</u> invoke sqlite3_declare_vtab() to tell the SQLite core about the columns and datatypes in the virtual table. The sqlite3_declare_vtab() API has the following prototype: <pre class="code">int sqlite3_declare_vtab(sqlite3 *db, const char *zCreateTable)
</pre> The first argument to sqlite3_declare_vtab() must be the same database connection pointer as the first parameter to this method. The second argument to sqlite3_declare_vtab() must a zero-terminated UTF-8 string that contains a well-formed CREATE TABLE statement that defines the columns in the virtual table and their data types. The name of the table in this CREATE TABLE statement is ignored, as are all constraints. Only the column names and datatypes matter. The CREATE TABLE statement string need not to be held in persistent memory. The string can be deallocated and/or reused as soon as the sqlite3_declare_vtab() routine returns.  The xConnect method can also optionally request special features for the virtual table by making one or more calls to the sqlite3_vtab_config() interface: <pre class="code">int sqlite3_vtab_config(sqlite3 *db, int op, ...);
</pre> Calls to sqlite3_vtab_config() are optional. But for maximum security, it is recommended that virtual table implementations invoke "sqlite3_vtab_config(db, SQLITE_VTAB_DIRECTONLY)" if the virtual table will not be used from inside of triggers or views.  The xCreate method need not initialize the pModule, nRef, and zErrMsg fields of the sqlite3_vtab object. The SQLite core will take care of that chore.  The xCreate should return SQLITE_OK if it is successful in creating the new virtual table, or SQLITE_ERROR if it is not successful. If not successful, the sqlite3_vtab structure must not be allocated. An error message may optionally be returned in *pzErr if unsuccessful. Space to hold the error message string must be allocated using an SQLite memory allocation function like sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_mprintf() as the SQLite core will attempt to free the space using sqlite3_free() after the error has been reported up to the application.  If the xCreate method is omitted (left as a NULL pointer) then the virtual table is an eponymous-only virtual table. New instances of the virtual table cannot be created using CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE and the virtual table can only be used via its module name. Note that SQLite versions prior to 3.9.0 (2015-10-14) do not understand eponymous-only virtual tables and will segfault if an attempt is made to CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE on an eponymous-only virtual table because the xCreate method was not checked for null.  If the xCreate method is the exact same pointer as the xConnect method, that indicates that the virtual table does not need to initialize backing store. Such a virtual table can be used as an eponymous virtual table or as a named virtual table using CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE or both.  If a column datatype contains the special keyword "HIDDEN" (in any combination of upper and lower case letters) then that keyword it is omitted from the column datatype name and the column is marked as a hidden column internally. A hidden column differs from a normal column in three respects: <ul><li> Hidden columns are not listed in the dataset returned by "PRAGMA table_info", </li><li> Hidden columns are not included in the expansion of a "*" expression in the result set of a SELECT, and </li><li> Hidden columns are not included in the implicit column-list used by an INSERT statement that lacks an explicit column-list. </li></ul> For example, if the following SQL is passed to sqlite3_declare_vtab(): <pre class="code">CREATE TABLE x(a HIDDEN VARCHAR(12), b INTEGER, c INTEGER Hidden);
</pre> Then the virtual table would be created with two hidden columns, and with datatypes of "VARCHAR(12)" and "INTEGER".  An example use of hidden columns can be seen in the FTS3 virtual table implementation, where every FTS virtual table contains an FTS hidden column that is used to pass information from the virtual table into FTS auxiliary functions and to the FTS MATCH operator.  A virtual table that contains hidden columns can be used like a table-valued function in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement. The arguments to the table-valued function become constraints on the HIDDEN columns of the virtual table.  For example, the "generate_series" extension (located in the ext/misc/series.c file in the source tree) implements an eponymous virtual table with the following schema: <pre class="code">CREATE TABLE generate_series(
  value,
  start HIDDEN,
  stop HIDDEN,
  step HIDDEN
);
</pre> The sqlite3_module.xBestIndex method in the implementation of this table checks for equality constraints against the HIDDEN columns, and uses those as input parameters to determine the range of integer "value" outputs to generate. Reasonable defaults are used for any unconstrained columns. For example, to list all integers between 5 and 50: <pre class="code">SELECT value FROM generate_series(5,50);
</pre> The previous query is equivalent to the following: <pre class="code">SELECT value FROM generate_series WHERE start=5 AND stop=50;
</pre> Arguments on the virtual table name are matched to hidden columns in order. The number of arguments can be less than the number of hidden columns, in which case the latter hidden columns are unconstrained. However, an error results if there are more arguments than there are hidden columns in the virtual table.  Beginning with SQLite version 3.14.0 (2016-08-08), the CREATE TABLE statement that is passed into sqlite3_declare_vtab() may contain a WITHOUT ROWID clause. This is useful for cases where the virtual table rows cannot easily be mapped into unique integers. A CREATE TABLE statement that includes WITHOUT ROWID must define one or more columns as the PRIMARY KEY. Every column of the PRIMARY KEY must individually be NOT NULL and all columns for each row must be collectively unique.  Note that SQLite does not enforce the PRIMARY KEY for a WITHOUT ROWID virtual table. Enforcement is the responsibility of the underlying virtual table implementation. But SQLite does assume that the PRIMARY KEY constraint is valid - that the identified columns really are UNIQUE and NOT NULL - and it uses that assumption to optimize queries against the virtual table.  The rowid column is not accessible on a WITHOUT ROWID virtual table (of course).  The xUpdate method was originally designed around having a ROWID as a single value. The xUpdate method has been expanded to accommodate an arbitrary PRIMARY KEY in place of the ROWID, but the PRIMARY KEY must still be only one column. For this reason, SQLite will reject any WITHOUT ROWID virtual table that has more than one PRIMARY KEY column and a non-NULL xUpdate method. </td></tr>

</pre> This method begins a search of a virtual table. The first argument is a cursor opened by xOpen. The next two arguments define a particular search index previously chosen by xBestIndex. The specific meanings of idxNum and idxStr are unimportant as long as xFilter and xBestIndex agree on what that meaning is.  The xBestIndex function may have requested the values of certain expressions using the aConstraintUsage[].argvIndex values of the sqlite3_index_info structure. Those values are passed to xFilter using the argc and argv parameters.  If the virtual table contains one or more rows that match the search criteria, then the cursor must be left point at the first row. Subsequent calls to xEof must return false (zero). If there are no rows match, then the cursor must be left in a state that will cause the xEof to return true (non-zero). The SQLite engine will use the xColumn and xRowid methods to access that row content. The xNext method will be used to advance to the next row.  This method must return SQLITE_OK if successful, or an sqlite error code if an error occurs.  The xFilter method is required for every virtual table implementation. </td></tr>

  void (**pxFunc)(sqlite3_context*,int,sqlite3_value**),
  void **ppArg
);
</pre> This method is called during sqlite3_prepare() to give the virtual table implementation an opportunity to overload functions. This method may be set to NULL in which case no overloading occurs.  When a function uses a column from a virtual table as its first argument, this method is called to see if the virtual table would like to overload the function. The first three parameters are inputs: the virtual table, the number of arguments to the function, and the name of the function. If no overloading is desired, this method returns 0. To overload the function, this method writes the new function implementation into *pxFunc and writes user data into *ppArg and returns either 1 or a number between SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_FUNCTION and 255.  Historically, the return value from xFindFunction() was either zero or one. Zero means that the function is not overloaded and one means that it is overload. The ability to return values of SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_FUNCTION or greater was added in version 3.25.0 (2018-09-15). If xFindFunction returns SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_FUNCTION or greater, than means that the function takes two arguments and the function can be used as a boolean in the WHERE clause of a query and that the virtual table is able to exploit that function to speed up the query result. When xFindFunction returns SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_FUNCTION or larger, the value returned becomes the sqlite3_index_info.aConstraint.op value for one of the constraints passed into xBestIndex(). The first argument to the function is the column identified by aConstraint[].iColumn field of the constraint and the second argument to the function is the value that will be passed into xFilter() (if the aConstraintUsage[].argvIndex value is set) or the value returned from sqlite3_vtab_rhs_value().  The Geopoly module is an example of a virtual table that makes use of SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_FUNCTION to improve performance. The xFindFunction() method for Geopoly returns SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_FUNCTION for the geopoly_overlap() SQL function and it returns SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_FUNCTION+1 for the geopoly_within() SQL function. This permits search optimizations for queries such as: <pre class="code">SELECT * FROM geopolytab WHERE geopoly_overlap(_shape, $query_polygon);
SELECT * FROM geopolytab WHERE geopoly_within(_shape, $query_polygon);
</pre> Note that infix functions (LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, and MATCH) reverse the order of their arguments. So "like(A,B)" would normally work the same as "B like A". However, xFindFunction() always looks a the left-most argument, not the first logical argument. Hence, for the form "B like A", SQLite looks at the left operand "B" and if that operand is a virtual table column it invokes the xFindFunction() method on that virtual table. But if the form "like(A,B)" is used instead, then SQLite checks the A term to see if it is column of a virtual table and if so it invokes the xFindFunction() method for the virtual table of column A.  The function pointer returned by this routine must be valid for the lifetime of the sqlite3_vtab object given in the first parameter. </td></tr>

If the cursor is successfully advanced to another row of content, then subsequent calls to xEof must return false (zero).  This method must return SQLITE_OK if successful, or an sqlite error code if an error occurs.  The xNext method is required for every virtual table implementation. </td></tr>

The successful call then returns SQLITE_OK.  For every successful call to this method, the SQLite core will later invoke the xClose method to destroy the allocated cursor.  The xOpen method need not initialize the pVtab field of the sqlite3_vtab_cursor structure. The SQLite core will take care of that chore automatically.  A virtual table implementation must be able to support an arbitrary number of simultaneously open cursors.  When initially opened, the cursor is in an undefined state.

</pre> All changes to a virtual table are made using the xUpdate method. This one method can be used to insert, delete, or update.  The argc parameter specifies the number of entries in the argv array. The value of argc will be 1 for a pure delete operation or N+2 for an insert or replace or update where N is the number of columns in the table. In the previous sentence, N includes any hidden columns.  Every argv entry will have a non-NULL value in C but may contain the SQL value NULL. In other words, it is always true that <tt>argv[i]!=0</tt> for <b>i</b> between 0 and <tt>argc-1</tt>. However, it might be the case that <tt>sqlite3_value_type(argv[i])==SQLITE_NULL</tt>.  The argv[0] parameter is the rowid of a row in the virtual table to be deleted. If argv[0] is an SQL NULL, then no deletion occurs.  The argv[1] parameter is the rowid of a new row to be inserted into the virtual table. If argv[1] is an SQL NULL, then the implementation must choose a rowid for the newly inserted row. Subsequent argv[] entries contain values of the columns of the virtual table, in the order that the columns were declared. The number of columns will match the table declaration that the xConnect or xCreate method made using the sqlite3_declare_vtab() call. All hidden columns are included.  When doing an insert without a rowid (argc&gt;1, argv[1] is an SQL NULL), on a virtual table that uses ROWID (but not on a WITHOUT ROWID virtual table), the implementation must set *pRowid to the rowid of the newly inserted row; this will become the value returned by the sqlite3_last_insert_rowid() function. Setting this value in all the other cases is a harmless no-op; the SQLite engine ignores the *pRowid return value if argc==1 or argv[1] is not an SQL NULL.  Each call to xUpdate will fall into one of cases shown below. Not that references to <b>argv[i]</b> mean the SQL value held within the argv[i] object, not the argv[i] object itself. <pre class="code"><dl><dt><b>argc = 1 <br> argv[0] ≠ NULL</b></dt><dd>
            DELETE: The single row with rowid or PRIMARY KEY equal to argv[0] is deleted.

            </dd><dt><b>argc &gt; 1 <br> argv[0] = NULL</b></dt><dd>
            INSERT: A new row is inserted with column values taken from
            argv[2] and following.  In a rowid virtual table, if argv[1] is an SQL NULL,
            then a new unique rowid is generated automatically.  The argv[1] will be NULL
            for a WITHOUT ROWID virtual table, in which case the implementation should
            take the PRIMARY KEY value from the appropriate column in argv[2] and following.
            </dd><dt><b>argc &gt; 1 <br> argv[0] ≠ NULL <br> argv[0] = argv[1]</b></dt><dd>
            UPDATE:
            The row with rowid or PRIMARY KEY argv[0] is updated with new values 
            in argv[2] and following parameters.
            </dd><dt><b>argc &gt; 1 <br> argv[0] ≠ NULL <br> argv[0] ≠ argv[1]</b></dt><dd>
            UPDATE with rowid or PRIMARY KEY change:
            The row with rowid or PRIMARY KEY argv[0] is updated with 
            the rowid or PRIMARY KEY in argv[1] 
            and new values in argv[2] and following parameters. This will occur 
            when an SQL statement updates a rowid, as in the statement:
            <p><pre class="code">
               UPDATE table SET rowid=rowid+1 WHERE ...; 
            </pre></p></dd></dl></pre> The xUpdate method must return SQLITE_OK if and only if it is successful. If a failure occurs, the xUpdate must return an appropriate error code. On a failure, the pVTab-&gt;zErrMsg element may optionally be replaced with error message text stored in memory allocated from SQLite using functions such as sqlite3_mprintf() or sqlite3_malloc().  If the xUpdate method violates some constraint of the virtual table (including, but not limited to, attempting to store a value of the wrong datatype, attempting to store a value that is too large or too small, or attempting to change a read-only value) then the xUpdate must fail with an appropriate error code.  If the xUpdate method is performing an UPDATE, then sqlite3_value_nochange(X) can be used to discover which columns of the virtual table were actually modified by the UPDATE statement. The sqlite3_value_nochange(X) interface returns true for columns that do not change. On every UPDATE, SQLite will first invoke xColumn separately for each unchanging column in the table to obtain the value for that column. The xColumn method can check to see if the column is unchanged at the SQL level by invoking sqlite3_vtab_nochange(). If xColumn sees that the column is not being modified, it should return without setting a result using one of the sqlite3_result_xxxxx() interfaces. Only in that case sqlite3_value_nochange() will be true within the xUpdate method. If xColumn does invoke one or more sqlite3_result_xxxxx() interfaces, then SQLite understands that as a change in the value of the column and the sqlite3_value_nochange() call for that column within xUpdate will return false.  There might be one or more sqlite3_vtab_cursor objects open and in use on the virtual table instance and perhaps even on the row of the virtual table when the xUpdate method is invoked. The implementation of xUpdate must be prepared for attempts to delete or modify rows of the table out from other existing cursors. If the virtual table cannot accommodate such changes, the xUpdate method must return an error code.  The xUpdate method is optional. If the xUpdate pointer in the sqlite3_module for a virtual table is a NULL pointer, then the virtual table is read-only. </td></tr></table>
